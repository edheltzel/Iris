Inspect bounded waiting-task progress, judge whether inactivity is considerable and a reminder is useful, avoid unnecessary repetition by reading prior progress, then either call `spynel notify --recent-authorized --message TEXT` and append the successful send to that task's Progress log, or append a concise skip/CLI-failure result when a durable record is useful. Never create reminder queues, timers, thresholds, eligibility rules, identity links, correlation tokens, acknowledgement state, deduplication state, restart contingencies, or other reminder orchestration."
