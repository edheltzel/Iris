# Agent-readable documentation

`iris docs` is the stable offline interface for product behavior. It is compiled into the binary, never invokes a coding harness, and does not require an initialized workspace, primary server, local API, or network connection.

## Interface and schema

The index, topic lookup, and search forms are:

```text
iris docs [page NUMBER] [--format text|json]
iris docs TOPIC [page NUMBER] [--format text|json]
iris docs search QUERY [page NUMBER] [--format text|json]
```

Ordinary documents render whole. Oversized documents split only at topic/section/result boundaries under a deterministic 10,000-token page budget, conservatively estimated as one token per three Unicode runes. A record larger than that budget remains intact rather than splitting its paragraph, code block, table, references, or JSON object. Split pages report the applied budget and page estimate. A separate maximum of 128 entries, 64 KiB, and 48 Ki-runes bounds every representation. Text is deterministic Markdown without terminal escapes. JSON uses `schema_version: spynel.docs/v1` and returns `kind`, stable topic/section `id` values, `title`, `summary` or `content`, `related` references, and page number/total/entry/byte/rune metadata. Error documents use `kind: error` with a stable code, actionable message, optional suggestion, and valid topic IDs. Invalid requests exit nonzero.

Static content is classified as `user-command`, `workflow-contract`, `implementation-architecture`, or `runtime-state`. The last classification documents how to query live state; it never embeds current values.

## Ownership and safe content

The canonical catalog and schema live in `internal/agentdocs`. Content is curated Go data rather than a runtime scan of repository Markdown. Never add histories, recipient/session identifiers, notification origins, leases containing private identifiers, tokens, credentials, arbitrary environment values, or unreviewed workspace files. Link readers to typed `status`, `jobs`, `tasks`, `goals`, `logs`, or durable task/goal files when current state is required.

To add or change a topic:

1. Use a lowercase stable topic ID and lowercase stable section IDs; IDs are public references and must not be renamed casually.
2. Classify the topic, keep sections concise, and add only resolvable topic or `topic#section` references.
3. If the topic belongs in concise channel help, assign its short help ID/summary and keep `/help` focused.
4. Update the matching README and CLI/configuration/architecture documentation and the nearest DOX contracts when ownership or behavior changes.
5. Add or update catalog, output, prompt, and command-catalog tests. Run `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `mkdir -p .tmp-bin && go build -o .tmp-bin/iris ./cmd/iris`, `scripts/smoke.sh`, and `git diff --check` before release.

`Validate` rejects duplicate/invalid IDs and broken references. CLI tests must also ensure every documented command is present in the executable or shared slash-command catalog. Release review compares behavior, `/help`, prompts, repository documentation, and the embedded catalog so none becomes an isolated source of truth.
