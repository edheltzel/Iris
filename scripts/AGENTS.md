# Scripts DOX

## Purpose

- Own reproducible development, smoke-test, and release helper scripts for Spynel.

## Local Contracts

- Scripts resolve paths relative to themselves and must not depend on the caller's working directory.
- Keep repository-local disposable script state only in purpose-specific ignored `.tmp*` directories: `.tmp-bin/` for development binaries, `.tmp-toolchains/` for the fallback Go distribution, `.tmp-tui-captures/` for default visual outputs, and `.tmp-artifacts/` for explicitly retained cross-review evidence. Every such directory must remain safe to remove wholesale.
- `dev.sh build` writes the repository development executable only to ignored `.tmp-bin/iris`; no generated root `bin/` directory or root `iris` file is allowed.
- `dev.sh test` includes the locally replaced Bubble Tea package explicitly alongside `./...` for both tests and vet, since Go excludes nested modules from that pattern.
- `install-dev.sh` reuses that disposable build, atomically installs the executable into `$SPYNEL_DEV_BIN_DIR` or the conventional per-user `$HOME/.local/bin`, never edits shell profiles, and reports exact PATH setup or shadowing guidance so later terminals can resolve the development build safely.
- Smoke tests use temporary projects and must not invoke live Codex, Claude Code, Pi, ACP agents, Telegram, or WhatsApp services; CLI-only smoke paths should avoid constructing a harness entirely.
- Keep Go-based developer-script policy tests in `dev_test.go`, not in an unrelated runtime package.
- The smoke test covers the user-bin development installer in an isolated target, canonical `.spynel/config.yaml` initialization without `workspace.state_dir`, exactly five valid persistent role-instruction files and content-free inspection, offline agent-readable docs, harness-independent plain CLI status, shared deterministic commands, every default-open and semantic task/goal view plus detailed and NDJSON output through their direct automation aliases, bounded conversation list/show/resume, strict inactive-follow-up rejection, every typed task/goal status folder, user-overridable prompt assets and workflow contracts, reviewed and explicit no-review task inspection, and harness-free direct task/goal helper output.
- Generated binaries stay in temporary or ignored directories and are removed when no longer required.
- `cold-cache.sh` is repository-only developer tooling for deliberately requested diagnostics. It creates one uniquely owned cache outside the repository, starts the command in a dedicated process group, validates and terminates the complete owned process tree (including descendants that escape that group), waits for it, and removes only that cache on success, failure, cancellation, and documented recovery paths.
- If host termination prevents the helper's trap from running, recovery is limited to the exact outside-repository `spynel-gocache.*` path recorded by that diagnostic. Find processes whose readable environment contains that exact `GOCACHE` value, terminate and wait for all of them, revalidate the path and its `spynel-gocache.*` ownership signature, then remove only that directory. Never delete by a broad name match or while an owned process remains live.
- `package-native.sh` accepts only path-safe release version identifiers, builds one of the four supported Linux/macOS host targets with CGO, stages and executes it with the matching sherpa-onnx/ONNX Runtime libraries, and packages those libraries and license notices beside the executable, including the retained Bubble Tea and Bubbles textarea licenses. Windows targets stop at an explicit temporary stub error before host or compilation work.
- `native-evidence` runs the synthetic `internal/harness` contract suite on the native host, safely extracts that host's archive into an awkward path, exercises only provider-free packaged commands, and writes a bounded, path-minimal JSON record classified as observed native evidence.
- `capture-tui.sh` owns deterministic true-color screenshots of representative TUI states. It captures every stock theme with the same 120-by-34 fixture and produces a labeled light/dark/accessibility contact sheet. Keep its fixtures synchronized with durable layout contracts and inspect the PNGs after meaningful visual changes.
- `terminal-copy-screen.mjs` replays the synthetic TUI PTY's optional F6/exit captures through a disposable pinned headless xterm installation. Assert visible rows, cursor, complete long text and retained history across cycles/resize/return under native and modeled ED 2 archival policies; the policy model is not a live Warp/macOS test. Every alternate-screen exit, including F6 and focus repaints, requires blank visible cells before restoration. Exit replay inspects visible alternate cells before restoration, exact normal-screen/history/cursor content afterward, modes, styles, and surviving diagnostics/echo; it does not infer emulator retention from escape emission. Installation and replay commands live in `docs/tui-editing.md`.

- `test-standalone.py` exercises piped bootstrap followed by immediate command lookup in the original shell, visible progress during a held-open download, shell PATH setup, ownership, rejected/corrupt downloads, native isolated primary and ownerless update/restart, and explicit uninstall against local candidate releases. Cover both plain and NDJSON ownerless completion, with exactly one correlated terminal JSON acknowledgment. Keep HOME, launcher paths, profiles, and workspace state isolated; uninstall must preserve workspaces and unrelated files and refuse unmanaged directories. Never touch the live installation or publish a release from this test.

- Standalone regression checks cover root and regular-user immediate launch with an unchanged parent PATH, including modeled sudo authorization when no directory is writable. Exercise public uninstall routing, simultaneous GitHub/npm removal, live-process and startup cleanup, and workspace preservation. Native Linux/macOS release runners execute the process-removal tests.

- `test-instance-updates.py` runs the native npm launcher against an isolated replacement package and local registry: a headless primary plus secondary and primary TUIs span two workspaces. Verify same-PID exec and working PTYs, channel-driven current-version restart without npm replacement, and rejection of older instances or older launchers supervising updated binaries. Build only a synthetic updated executable, keep all user homes/workspaces private, and stop only fixture-owned subprocesses.
